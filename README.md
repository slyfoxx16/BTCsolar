# BTCsolar

This GitHub repository contains a Python script that estimates the size of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system needed to power a Bitcoin (BTC) miner. The script utilizes the PySAM (Python for System Advisor Model) library from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to calculate the PV system's production.

### Prerequisites

To use this script, you will need to have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* PySAM
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* seaborn

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the repository's directory using the command line.
Run the script using the command: python pv_sizing.py
Follow the prompts to enter the required information for your BTC mining operation, including BTC miner power consumption, energy consumption rate, location, and PV system specifications.
The script will output the estimated size of the PV system needed to power your BTC miner, based on the data entered.
Note: This script is intended for educational and estimation purposes only. It does not account for all factors that may affect the performance of a solar PV system and should not be used as the sole source of information for system design.
